# Community Building Techniques
#### written with collaborative input from Team MYSS
Roster: Yeidy Levels, Marisa Shuman, Sarah McCoy, Shana Elizabeth Henry

### Target Environment: School
School Attributes:
* school size: 140
* school grade range: 9-12
* faculty count: 0 (I am part-time, I teach math in the morning and CS in the afternoon) One other teacher teaches 1 semester every 2 years. 
* courses: Creative Web, Creative Computing thru Art, Physical Computing, Physical Science and computing, and TBD.  All classes are semester long, intro level.

### System: CS Leads

#### How It Works
We have had CS Leads for the past 3 years.  We have a different focus each year. 
* We trained staff during morning meetings to learn CS concepts that were being taught that year.
* We held a PD for all staff to be trained on Scratch
* We created a school wide Intensive focused on CS (content and ethics)

more prose...
1. not sure what this is...
2. We tried to host a session for our school community, but zero parents came but it was online.
3. Love that we get paid per session to develop a CS community at our school via the CS Leads program


#### Expected Positive Outcomes
This is attractive because...
* CS committment to increase visibility is paired w/ funding
* CS classes are part of social equity goals
* teachers see connections to their classes
* student took a CS course during the summer w/ a scholarship from Upperline Code

#### Rollout Timeline
* One week was spent creating the 'workbook' which helped plan out the goals for the school for that year. Admin support is mandatory.
* It takes years to build culture and my transfer high school has to re-create culture constantly w/ our transient population.

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
1. CS offerings every semester
2. CS Leads operational
3. Alum that contemplate CS major

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
* Roster numbers are dwindling.  We need students.
